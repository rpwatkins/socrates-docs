= Managing References with Socrates and Zotero

The purpose of this guide is to illustrate how to generate in text

Socrates support the generation of citations and a bibliography through Asciidoctor-bibiliography. This requires a _references.bib_ file (created by _init_) that contains bibtex compliant references. One could of course manually edit the references in _references.bib_, but it is far easier to have a citation manager do this for you. Many citation managers can export in bibtex format.

Zotero is a free and open-source bibliographic database and manager. It can easily export bibtex compliant files of the sort we need.
